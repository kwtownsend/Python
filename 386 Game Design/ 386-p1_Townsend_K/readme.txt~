# description: Uses the MyPRNG class this is the executable file and tells you whether you are warmer/colder

This program mostly works with the parameters that were given for the assignment. I'm not familiar with getopts, or very familiar with python
so I figured that accepting inputs into variables was the way that you referred to as doing it by hand. Another thing I wasn't able to figure
out was how to make the __init__ take zero arguments as a constructor. It also throws up problems if you don't do anything in the constructor
I'm unsure if it's just because of my lack of familiarity with python. I used the default values from the article where a = 16807, and 
m = 2147483647. To make sure it was in the range I checked the random number to see if it was less then the minimum and if it was I added the 
minimum to the total number, and if it was over the maximum I took the (random number) % maximum. I put in as many fail-safes for bad user input
as I could think of. Other then that it's a pretty straightforward program you execute it by going to the folder and just typing ./guess.py then
the command prompt will ask you 'Enter seed for rng:(blank uses current second of time) ' if its left blank it is self explanatory it uses the
current seconds of the whatever time it is. Then it will prompt you 'Enter Minimum range number:(blank will use 1) ' where again left blank will
use the given default value. Then last it will prompt you for 'Enter Maximum range number:(blank will use 1000) ' where if you just hit enter
it will set it to 1000. Then the program will calculate random numbers and the 101st one it will set to the random number you have to guess.
Then using your best guess it will tell you whether you are colder or warmer and if you are warmer will set your new closest guess.
