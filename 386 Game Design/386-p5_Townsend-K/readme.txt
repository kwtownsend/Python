Files Needed:
    1. game.py - main game code
    2. barrierclass.py - class for barriers in game
    3. bulletclass.py - class for projectiles in game
    4. enemyclass.py - class for enemy squares

    6. powerupclass.py - class for powerup squares
    7. Times_New_Roman_Normal.ttf - font used in game.py for menu, etc.

How to run:
    Compile game.py in whatever way you need to. This was made using windows IDLE (Python GUI) and Python 3.4.3

Bug/Feature:
    Depending on how you view it may be a bug or feature. When you push down any key it will shoot projectiles for the player.
    This is because of the nature of the key_down which is part of the pygame library. I don't really understand how it works
    enough to fix it, although I tried.
